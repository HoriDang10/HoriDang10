<p>
Hey guys! I'm currently a junior major in data science. My daily goal is to grow constantly. 
Cause of my true passion is solving problems, so I'm aiming to work as a software engineer or data engineer in the nearest future.

<p>
I love data science, but I get more thrilled about technical challenges and creative problem-solving in the engineering fields. I'm always looking for new ways to learn and grow in this field that is always evolving. By trial and error, I want to improve upon the person I was a day ago.
